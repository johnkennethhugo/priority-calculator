# Prioritization Level Calculator (ReactJS, HTML, CSS) - JKH

Welcome to the Prioritization Level Calculator.

This project aims to assist in determining the priority level of tasks, ranging from 1 to 8. Priority 1 denotes the most urgent, while priority 8 indicates the least urgent.

**Status:** Work in Progress

The prioritization level generator is currently under development and has been temporarily replaced with a random number generator as a placeholder. Implementation is expected within the week.
